Explain the two laws of reflection.,"The laws of reflection are as follows: 1. The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface at the point  of the incidence lie in the same plane. 2. The angle which the incident ray makes with the normal is equal to the angle which the reflected ray makes to the same normal.","The first law of reflection states that the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface of the mirror, all lie in the same plane. The second law of reflection states that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. Both angles are measured with respect to the normal to the mirror.",entailment
What are renewable resources ?,"The resources which can be renewed or reproduced by physical, chemical or mechanical processes are known as renewable or replenishable resources. For example, solar and wind energy, water, forests and wildlife, etc.","A renewable resource is one that can be used repeatedly and does not run out because it is naturally replaced. Examples of renewable resources include solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy.",entailment
What are renewable resources ?,"The resources which can be renewed or reproduced by physical, chemical or mechanical processes are known as renewable or replenishable resources. For example, solar and wind energy, water, forests and wildlife, etc.","These occur over a very long geological time. These resources take millions of years in their formation. Some of the resources like metals are recyclable and some like fossil fuels cannot be recycled and get exhausted with their use. For example, coal, bauxite.",contradiction
What represents the life span of an organism?,The life span of an organism is defined as the period from the birth of the organism to the natural death of an organism.,The period from the birth of the organism to the death of that organism is known as life span.,entailment
A mixture of oxygen and ethyne is burnt for welding. Can you tell why a mixture of ethyne and air is not used ?,"A mixture of ethyne and air is not used for welding because burning of ethyne in air produces a sooty flame due to incomplete combustion, which is not enough to melt metals for welding.","mixture of ethyne and air is not used for welding because burning of ethyne in air produces a sooty flame, which is enough to melt metals for welding.",contradiction
Characteristics of homologous series,All members of a homologous series can be represented by the same general formula.Any two adjacent homologues differ by one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms in their molecular formulae.,The difference in the molecular masses of any two adjacent homologues is 14u.All the compounds of a homologous series show similar chemical properties.,neutral
Write the defination of force,"Force is defined as an external cause that changes or tends to change the state of the body once applied, if the body is in motion it comes to rest and if at rest then will come to motion","In physics, a force is an influence that can change the motion of an object.",entailment
definition of velocity,"The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time",it can be defined as the rate of change of the objectâ€™s position with respect to a frame of reference and time.,entailment
what is parser?,Parser is a compiler that is used to break the data into smaller elements coming from lexical analysis phase.A parser takes input in the form of sequence of tokens and produces output in the form of parse tree.,"The parser is that phase of the compiler which takes a token string as input and with the help of existing grammar, converts it into the corresponding Intermediate Representation. The parser is also known as Syntax Analyzer. ",entailment
Why parse tree is required?,It helps in making syntax analysis by reflecting the syntax of the input language. It uses an in-memory representation of the input with a structure that conforms to the grammar.,By using the parse tree we can define the dependecy easily and input string be checked easily.By using the pare tree precedence of the grammer can be defined easily.,entailment
what do you mean by complier?,A Compiler is computer software that transforms program source code which is written in a high-level language into low-level machine code. It essentially translates the code written in one programming language to another language without changing the logic of the code.,The compiler is software that converts a program written in a high-level language (Source Language) to low-level language (Object/Target/Machine Language). ,entailment
what is Symbol table?,"A symbol table is a data structure containing a record for each identifier, with fields for the attributes of the identifier. The data structure allows us to find the record for each identifier quickly and to store or retrieve data from that record quickly.",Symbol Table is an important data structure created and maintained by the compiler in order to keep track parssing table. ,neutral
Define operator precedence grammer.,"An operator precedence grammar is a kind of grammar for formal languages. Technically, an operator precedence grammar is a context-free grammar that has the property that no production has either an empty right-hand side or two adjacent nonterminals in its right-hand side","Operator precedence grammar is kinds of shift reduce parsing method. It is applied to a small class of operator grammars. A grammar is said to be operator precedence grammar if it has two properties,like -No R.H.S. of any production has a,No two non-terminals are adjacent.",entailment
why we calculate first of an production in complier design?,"If the compiler would have come to know in advance, that what is the first character of the string produced when a production rule is applied, and comparing it to the current character or token in the input string it sees, it can wisely take decision on which production rule to apply.",If first of any production is caculated at first then it wiil be more easy to determine the seqenence of character in production rule.,entailment
when a grammer is said to be ambiguous?,A grammar is said to be ambiguous if there exists more than one leftmost derivation or more than one rightmost derivative or more than one parse tree for the given input string. If the grammar is not ambiguous then it is called unambiguous.,If there exist multiple  cfg for a particular grammer.,neutral
what do you mean by DFA?,"In DFA, for each input symbol, one can determine the state to which the machine will move. Hence, it is called Deterministic Automaton. As it has a finite number of states, the machine is called Deterministic Finite Machine or Deterministic Finite Automaton.",DFA or non deterministic finite automate is part of autotmata in which all production rules are not defined deterministicly.By applying proper alphabet on a particular state we can go to a predefined state only.,contradiction
what is inheritance?,Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.,Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object inherits all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.,entailment
what is inheritance?,Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.,Polymorphism is a technique by which we can perform a single action in different ways.,neutral
Which variables can be accessed without creating an object of a class and why?,Static variables can be accessed without creating an object of a class. Because it gets loaded at the load time of class.,final variables can be accessed without creating an object of a class because all final variables are preloaded.,contradiction
Why is Java not a pure object oriented language?,"Java supports primitive data types - byte, boolean, char, short, int, float, long, and double and hence it is not a pure object-oriented language.",Java supports primitive data types also.,entailment
what is OS?,OS is the most essential and vital part of a computer without which it is considered useless. It enables an interface or acts like a link for interaction between computer software that is installed on OS and users. It also helps to communicate with hardware and also maintains balance among hardware and CPU. It also provides services to users and a platform for programs to run on. It performs all common tasks applications require,OS is the most essential and vital part of a computer without which it is considered useless.
